		* Why does the following output true?

			a is a string set to a value of "false" but it is truthy as any string that is not empty is true.  b is defined as true.  So a is true and b is true, so a and b is true.
		*/
		console.log (b && a);
		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		*/
		/*
			Unsure...a guess...I know it's printing the value of a, not the boolean of a but I don't know why....

			It's called short circuiting.  && returns the first false value (because the statement is false) or the last value.  || returns the first truth value or the last value, which would mean the statement is true.
